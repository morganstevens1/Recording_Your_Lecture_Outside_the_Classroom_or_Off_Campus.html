<h3>
    Recording Your Lecture: Outside the Classroom or Off-Campus
</h3>
<p>
    Bryn Mawr subscribes to a lecture capture service called Panopto,
    which is designed to make it easy for people to record lectures 
    and talks and post the recordings for others to view them. Panopto 
    can simultaneously capture audio and video of a person lecturing and
    a screencast of what they project overhead from the podium computer during
    a lecture. Recordings are automatically uploaded to Panopto's servers 
    and can be shared with students via a course Moodle site or with viewers
    outside of a course via a public link. It is quick and easy to record with Panopto 
    off campus or at home! Read on to find out how to do so!

<h4>
    Getting Ready to Record
</h4>
<p>
    When getting ready to record, ensure that you have:
    <ol>
        <li>
            A computer (preferably with a built-in webcam)
        </li>
        <li>
            A reliable internet connection
        </li>
        <li>
            Successfully installed the Panopto Desktop App onto
            the computer you will be using to record (Check out these links for instructions
            on how to freely download and install the software <a href="https://support.panopto.com/s/article/Install-Panopto-for-Mac">For downloading onto a Mac</a>
            <a href="https://support.panopto.com/s/article/Install-Panopto-for-Windows">For downloading onto a PC</a>).
        </li>
    </ol>
    <b>Please note:</b>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>If your computer doesn't have a webcam you can always
                borrow one
            </strong>
            from Canaday Library's equiptment loan pool. (<a href="https://tripod.brynmawr.edu/discovery/collectionDiscovery?vid=01TRI_INST:BMC&inst=01TRI_INST&collectionId=81266509260004921">

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                You will also need to have a Teacher role in a Moodle site in order to record lectures.
            </strong>
            (Any Moodle site will do, it doesn't have to be an academic course-related site.) If you
            don't have one already, please email <a href="mailto:help@brynmawr.edu">e-mail help@brynmawr.edu</a>

<h4>
    Starting a Recording
</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Login to your computer and <u>open any applications and files that you will use to during your lecture</u>.
        For example, if you wanted to show PowerPoint slides, a web page, and an image in a PDF
        document, you would open your PowerPoint file, your web browser, and the PDF file.
        <li type = "circle">

                    Note:
                </b> 
                Panopto will use all of the RAM, cache space, and processing power available when it is launched.
                Opening your presentation materials before opening Panopto ensuresthat computer resources are
                reserved for those processes.
